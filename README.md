# Unite Filelist

Based on Lucky Mike's answer for the stack overflow topic: [Navigating through a huge project
with vim and unite.vim plugin](http://stackoverflow.com/a/25171430/4542656), this plugin creates
a file list and use its content as source for [Unite](https://github.com/Shougo/unite.vim).
